My Journey Through The C Programming Language, by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Richie (2nd Ed. 1988)

After years of playing around with higher level languages, I've come to realize that my memory of C has faltered. 
I am only doing this to stay motivated as I trudge along through the book. These answers are by no means definitive, but I will only upload them if I know they're correct.

Notes:

    1. CMake is a necessary evil. I am also reading the textbook on it to learn more about all of the crazy internal functions it has. The Ninja Generator is neat.
